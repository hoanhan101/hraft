# hstore

**hstore** is a fault-tolerant distributed key-value store. 

It is written in Go and uses the Raft consensus algorithm 
to manage a highly-available replicated log.

The project uses [MIT's 6.824: Distributed
System course](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/) as a guideline and aims to
add more features on top of that.

Here is the project's [proposal](PROPOSAL.md). Other parts will be updated as
soon as it is live and ready.
